      <span class="style7"><strong>(1)<span class="tou STYLE39">Are these items on this site EP ready?What do I need to prepare before install ? </span><br>
      <br>
      </strong>Yes.the  Custom Content in our site are EP ready.<br />
      <br />
Prepare:<br />
1.
          You need to install a genuine copy of The Sims2,on the basis of which most parts of items of our site are created,and minor parts of them need some special expansion packs. ( <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/about/index.php?pid=pcgames_index" target="_blank">More Sims2's INFO in                                 official site</a> ) <br />
          <br />
2. You need to install CEP(Color Enable Package) to show custom recolours of Maxis objects.<br />
( <a href="http://sims.ambertation.de/en/cep/" target="_blank">Download CEP in                                 official site</a> ) <br>

    <p><strong>(2)<span class="tou STYLE39">What is the <span class="STYLE9">MESH</span>? Why must I download MESH ?</span> <br>
      <br>
      </strong>Mesh is the BASE of 
      recolor items.you must download MESH first to use all recolor items. the items will be not appear in your game without MESH. <br>
      <span class="style2"><span class="style7"><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span><br>
    <br>
    <strong>(3)<span class="tou STYLE39">How to unzip the files? And why it says the files are corrupted?</span><br>
    <br>
    </strong>Firstly you need an extractor like <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">Winzip</a> or <a href="http://www.win-rar.com/" target="_blank">Winrar</a>. <br />
    <br />
Then double click the zip files you¡¯ve downloaded to  uncompress them step by step following the operating instructions.<br />
<br />
All items on this site have been  thoroughly tested and debugged and surely can be downloaded. Most likely the  message pops up just because there¡¯s a block in the network, or you¡¯ve only  downloaded parts of a zip file. And all you have to do is to redownload it completely.<br />
<br />
If you find any problem of our sims2 items ,feel free to <a href="mailto:peggysims2.net@hotmail.com">contact  us</a> , thanks. <br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span></p>
    <p><strong>(3)<span class="tou STYLE39">How do I get these files into my game?</span><br>
      <br>
        </strong>1.Please unzip the zip files  you¡¯ve downloaded;<br />
        <br />
        2.After that, pay attention that  if the package is in <span class="style27">xxxxxx.sims2pack</span> format,  simply double-click it to install it into your game.<br />
        <br />
You can also use Clean Installer ( <a href="http://sims2pack.modthesims2.com/" target="_blank">Download Clean Installer in their official site</a> ) <br />
<br />
3 And if the package file is in <span class="style27">xxxxx.package</span> format, you  just need to move and save it to <br />
<br />
<span class="biaoti style19">\Documents and Settings\My Documents\EA  Games\The Sims 2\Downloads</span>.<br />
<br />
(<span class="biaoti style19">Max</span>:  Users\(Current User name)\Documents\EA   Games\The Sims 2\Downloads\ )<br />
(<span class="biaoti style19">Vista</span>:  Users\(Current User name)\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads\  )<br />
<br />
NOTICE: Downloads go in the folder inside 'My Documents', NOT under the SIMS2 GAME Program Files<br />
<br />
4. If you have no Downloads folder,created a new one by yourself  is OK . <br />
<br />
You should be in the folder My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\. Right-click in a   blank space in the folder and click New, then Folder. Then named it: ' <span class="biaoti style19">Downloads</span> ',it' has a capital D and a lowercase s at the end.<br />
<br />
5. Do not establish any sub-folder under the DOWNLOADS  folder, otherwise maybe the items you¡¯ve downloaded won¡¯t show up in your game. <br>
      <br>

    <p><strong>(4)<span class="tou STYLE39">Why some items don't show up in my game?</span><br>
      <br>
        </strong>All  possible reasons are listed here why some objects you've downloaded don't show  up in your game:<br />
        <br />
        1.Maybe you  failed to download the necessary mesh of an item;<br />
        <br />
        2.Maybe you  just downloaded is not completely,redownload please;<br />
        <br />
        3.Maybe you  failed to uncompress the packages correctly;<br />
        <br />
        4.Maybe you  located the packages to the wrong place;<br />
        <br />
        5.Maybe the version of your game or EP  is outdated, so it collides with some of the items you've downloaded;<br />
        <br />
        6.Maybe you do  not have the EP that the item requires;<br />
        <br />
        7.If you are getting an error with the Body Shop Installer saying &quot;This content requires Expansion Pack data that is not installed&quot;,but you are sure you have the required EP for a lot , get and install Clean Installer ( <a href="http://sims2pack.modthesims2.com/" target="_blank">Download Clean Installer in their official site</a> )  and use it to install your Sims2pack files instead. <br />
        <br />
        8.Maybe the  hardware of your PC dosn't support your game;<br />
        <br />
        9.After entering your game maybe you  didn't enable this option :Custom Content<strong><br>
